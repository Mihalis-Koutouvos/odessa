## **Introduction**

Odessa is a chatbot application for the healthcare industry that utilizes a conversational approach 
to assist the user of the app in learning more about certain symptoms they are going through and conditions 
that they may be aware of as a result of the chatbot. That being said, Odessa aims to help users self-diagnose 
themselves. However, keep in mind that I, Odessa, and not an alternative to seeing an actual doctor. Please seek the 
correct and appropriate medical professionals so that you can receive proper diagnosis and treatment.

## **Programming Tools and Other Technical Features**

To begin, Odessa was coded in Python. However, to actually train the data that I used, Pytorch came in handy, alongside 
libraries including NumPy, NLTK, json, and random; I also employed the Tkinter library to design the GUI behind Odessa.
